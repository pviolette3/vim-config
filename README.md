Patrick Violette's vim config
==========================

Installation
------------
Clone this repository, change the working directory to vim-config, and then run the install shell script:
```
bash install.sh
```

This script copies configuration files and sets up Vundle automatically.

NOTE: The script does a fresh install, so it WILL delete the entire .vim
directory and .vimrc.
